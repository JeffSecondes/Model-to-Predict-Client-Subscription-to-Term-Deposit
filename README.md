## <b>AML 3104 Project:</b>
## <b>Model to Predict Client Subscription to Term Deposit</b>

<b>Problem Statement:</b>
- A bank needs to identify customers who are likely to subscribe to Term Deposit. This will help the bank improve its strategies and optimize marketing campaigns by targeting the right customers.

<b>Objectives:</b>
- Identify factors affecting propensity to subscribe to Term Deposit
- Build a predictive model to identify and segment customers based on their likelihood to get the product
- Deploy the application on a cloud platform so that it is accessible to users

<b>Summary:</b>
- The project evaluates and optimizes a marketing campaign dataset to predict customer subscription to a product which is Term Deposit. The dataset includes various features such as age, job type, marital status, education level, and financial information with the target variable being whether a customer subscribed ('yes') or not ('no'). The project uses feature engineering to enhance predictive capabilities of machine learning models. Two models are employed: Decision Tree classifier and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Both the Decision Tree  and ANN models are evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- The project concludes with a comparative analysis of the Decision Tree and ANN models, emphasizing their strengths and weaknesses in predicting customer subscriptions. The performance of the ANN and decision tree models is nearly identical. But since the decision tree is easier to understand and more straightforward, this will be the final model. This comprehensive approach ensures a thorough understanding of the marketing campaign's effectiveness and facilitates data-driven decision-making for future campaigns.
